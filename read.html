            <h1>Final Entry</h1>
            <p>Work experimentally if you can. Go anywhere that seems safe enough. Enter <em>everything</em>. And I do mean everything.</p>
            <p>I can't help but think that the doors I ignored could have led to my freedom much sooner.</p>
            <p>I've been losing time in here. I'm sure that it shouldn't have been possible for me to be trapped here for so long.</p>
            <p>Especially not without food or water.</p>
            <p>Something is very wrong with this place, that's for sure.</p>
            <p>But, if I'm immortal here, then I don't want to leave. Who knows what will happen to me outside this maze?</p>
            <p>I've been here too long to risk leaving.</p>
            <p>If you've followed my instructions then you'll reach the end soon enough. Just remember what I told you. If it hasn't been too long for you then you have the chance - and choice - that I never did.</p>
