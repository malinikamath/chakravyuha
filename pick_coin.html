            <h1>Truth Unburied</h1>
            <p>You're too curious for your own good.</p>
            <p>Examining the coin brings the faint stirrings of familiarity to the forefront of your mind.</p>
            <p>You know this coin. You've seen it before. In fact - this coin is what you saw before you woke up in the maze.</p>
            <p>The horrifying truth wakes within you. Every death, every wrong turn, every mistaken choice that meant restarting 
                in the center of that cursed maze with no memory of your previous attempts: everything comes back to you. You've
                tried escaping this maze dozens of times before succeeded in your current run.
            </p>
            <p>This coin is what brought you here. Who cares how it appeared next to the explorer, you <em>know</em> that this very coin was with you 
                before you entered the maze. It slips from your fingers as you realize its allure.
            </p>
            <p>In fact - you remember holding this coin at this very moment and making the choice to bury it instead of returning it to its accursed home.</p>
            <p>Shaken, you wrap the coin in a bit of cloth from the explorer's old clothes and throw it back into the maze exit.</p>
            <p>Who knows what it will do if it's left out here to lure another unsuspecting person into the maze?</p>
