            <p>You get a funny feeling, like your mind is bubbling over.</p>
            <p>Your memories start to feel fuzzy. It is definitely not a good idea to keep moving forward.</p>
            <p>You want to escape: that's what's most important. Should you try finding the notebook again
                for another clue? Or try your luck with the lock again? Or maybe continue forward and hope nothing happens?</p>
