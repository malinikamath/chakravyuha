            <p>You find yourself in a maze, the likes of which you've never seen before. You know that someone has been here before you: they've left a note with directions on how to escape.</p>
            <p>But that's not important. You're more concerned about what happened to them.</p>
            <p>Search for clues as you navigate the maze. Maybe it will help.</p>
