            <p>This game is based on the story of the chakravyuha from the Sanskrit epic called "Mahabharata".</p>
            <p>The Mahabharata is the history of the "Great Bharata" dynasty. Bharata himself was a legendary emperor,
                but the story focuses on his descendants: the 5 Pandava brothers and their 100 cousins, the Kauravas.</p>
            <p>The story is very long, so it's useless to try and summarize it cleanly, but one part of it that 
                always stuck with me was the story of Abhimanyu, son of Arjun and Subhadra. Subhadra was 
                the sister of Krishna, one of the avatars of Vishnu, the God of Preservation. 
                Arjun's father was Indra, King of the Devas and Heavens, God of Weather, 
                Lightning, Storms, etc, and he was very skilled with the bow and arrow. With this storied ancestry, Abhimanyu 
                was, in some ways, born to greatness. But he also earned his fame.</p>
            <p>One of Abhimanyu's accomplishments was learning how to break into the "chakravyuha", a sort of living
                labyrinth with walls made from soldiers carrying shields. The Chakravyuha was a technique that very few 
                warriors knew how to break. What's important in this lore is that he only 
                learned how to break <em>into</em> the chakravyuha, not how to break out.
            </p>
            <p>Arjun, who had complete knowledge of the Chakravyuha, was distracted in battle 
                so the Kauravas could deploy the Chakravyuha to crush the Pandava army. Due to his (incomplete) knowledge, Abhimanyu led the 
                force that would break the maze, and defeated many of the warriors from the opposing side. His strength was 
                so great that the Kauravas broke the rules of warriors and sent multiple people to fight Abhimanyu at once.
            </p>
            <p>Despite the overwhelming disadvantage he faced, with his chariot, horses, and weapons destroyed, Abhimanyu still fought 
                on with the wheel of his chariot until he eventually succumbed to his wounds after a head injury. He was sixteen years old.
            </p>
            <p>Obviously this is one of multiple versions people know, but this is the story as I remember it. I was always fascinated 
                with the idea of Abhimanyu's tragedy: knowing he was the only one who could enter the maze and committing to it despite 
                the danger.</p>
            <p>I thought it would be interesting to have a maze that someone else knew how to enter but never managed to escape,
                so that you could learn from their knowledge despite it not being enough to save them.
            </p>
            <p>I hope you enjoy(ed) playing!</p>
