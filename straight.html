            <p>You think the writer must have been eaten at some point.</p>
            <p>Maybe they were drained of too much of whatever it is that this place eats off of humans like you.</p>

            <p>You decide to abandon the notebook here. There were many copies of it at the center of the maze, so you can afford to leave this one. Plus, you remember your previous choices well enough to recreate them.</p>
            <p>Probably.</p>
